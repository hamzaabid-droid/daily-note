Git Basics – Simple Notes
Repository
A repository is a place where Git stores project files and their complete history. It can be local (on
your computer) or remote (on GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
Commit
A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific time. It includes changes, author info, date, and
a message.
Working Tree
The working tree is where you edit files. Changes here are not yet saved in Git history.
Staging Area
The staging area is where you prepare files before committing. It lets you choose what goes into the
next commit.
Local vs Remote Repository
Local repository is on your system. Remote repository is online and used for sharing and backup.
Common Git Commands
git init – Create a new repository
git status – Check current state
git add – Add files to staging area
